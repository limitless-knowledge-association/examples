# examples
Let us broaden our horizons

This project contains examples (in various languages) for doing the sorts of things
that people often don't even realize they might want to do.

It's used routinely to hold code references for the blog at 
[Limitless Knowledge Association](http://blog.limitless.org).

This is all MIT license. Feel free to download, copy, use in commercial or non-commercial projects
as you see fit. Not even attribution is demanded, though it is appreciated so that if anyone finds
a problem in what you copied the words gets back to us so we can fix it.

Remember: Experts make the difficult look easy -- the impossible just takes a little longer!
